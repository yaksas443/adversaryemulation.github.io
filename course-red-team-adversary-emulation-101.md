# Course - Red Team Adversary Emulation 101

In this course, we look at an organization's security from a real-world adversary perspective. You are hired by a FinTech startup to conduct an adversary emulation exercise and steal their customer data (before an actual adversary). This exercise assumes zero knowledge about the target network. 

This is a beginner friendly course. If you have just started your career in offensive cybersecurity or are preparing for penetration testing certifications like OSCP, eJPT, ePTP, CRTP etc. then this course is for you.
