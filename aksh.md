# Managing Self-hosted Labs via AKSH

Necessity is the mother of invetion. That's how AKSH came into being.

When I created the course [Red Team Adversary Emulation: Mimicking a real-world cyber attack](https://yks.red/RTAE), I wanted to provide a means to students to practice the attacks, demonstrated in the course, in a real-world lab. 

## Lab access (self-hosted)

If you want to hack the Tax First Labz network, you can do so by hosting the lab network in your own AWS account. To check self-hosting prerequisites and eligibility please fill the form below. Once the instructor approves, you will be provided access to AKSH, our lab management bot on [Discord](https://yks.red/discord). You can ask AKSH to automatically deploy / destroy the lab environment in your AWS account, list machines, check lab status, start, stop, reboot and revert machines.
